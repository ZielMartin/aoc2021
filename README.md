# Advent of Code 2021

This is my humble attempt to complete all of the challenges in the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/) on the day, they are released (which I will most likely fail *sometimes, most of the time*).

Most problems will probably be solved using typescript, but java or other languages may also be used.
